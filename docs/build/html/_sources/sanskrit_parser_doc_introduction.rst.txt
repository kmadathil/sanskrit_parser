Introduction
=========================================

The goal of the sanskrit_parser project is to create a freely reusable open
source sanskrit parser and generator. This is intended to be usable as a
python library for other tools that need sanskrit parsing and generation, as
well as providing basic command line and web user interfaces for basic tasks.

We aim to be

* Freely reusable (the more the merrier)
* Open Source
* Classical - We favour traditional grammar over statistical methods,
   but use statistical methods where necessary and helpful.
